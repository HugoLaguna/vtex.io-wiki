# VTEX.IO


All development in the VTEX platform starts with the
[VTEX.IO Toolbelt](https://github.com/vtex/toolbelt)
, our CLI that allows you to log in, manage installed apps and develop new
ones.

<p>First, you need to ensure your computer has <b> Node >=8 </b> installed. Then, use `npm`, the node package manager, to globally install the `vtex`</p>

    > npm install --global vtex

<p>You can test if everything works by calling `vtex`, which will show you a
help text with all available commands.</p>
